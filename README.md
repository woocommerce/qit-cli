## Overview

The Quality Insights Toolkit (QIT) is an automated testing tool developed by WooCommerce for extension developers in the [Woo Marketplace](https://woocommerce.com/products/). It allows you to run various types of tests on your extension in a managed environment and receive feedback on potential issues or errors.

## Installing QIT

You can install QIT in three different ways:

### Per Project

1. Run `composer require woocommerce/qit-cli --dev`
2. Execute `./vendor/bin/qit` to authenticate with your WooCommerce.com Partner Developer account.

### Globally Using Composer

1. Run `composer global require woocommerce/qit-cli`
2. Execute `qit` to authenticate with your WooCommerce.com Partner Developer account. Ensure that the Composer bin folder is in your PATH. [Example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64545124).

### Globally Using `wget`

_(Pro Tip: Opting for the Composer installation method simplifies the process of updating QIT in the future ðŸ˜‰)_
1. Run `wget https://github.com/woocommerce/qit-cli/raw/trunk/qit`
2. Execute `chmod +x qit`
3. Move the file to a directory in your PATH, such as `sudo mv qit /usr/local/bin/qit`
4. Run `qit` to authenticate with your WooCommerce.com Partner Developer account.

## Examples

- `qit run:e2e my-extension` - Runs the WooCommerce Core E2E tests with your extension active.
- `qit run:e2e my-extension --php_version=8.2` - Same as above, but with PHP 8.2.
- `qit run:e2e my-extension --php_version=8.2 --woocommerce_version=rc --wordpress_version=rc` - Same as above, but with PHP 8.2, and the release candidate versions of WooCommerce and WordPress, if they are available.
- `qit run:e2e my-extension --zip` - Runs the tests using your development build zip, that is still unreleased.
- `qit run:e2e my-extension --additional_wordpress_plugins=gutenberg` - Activates the "Gutenberg" feature plugin in the test environment as well.

### Supported Tests

- [End-to-End Test](https://woocommerce.github.io/qit-documentation/#/test-types/e2e)
- [Activation Test](https://woocommerce.github.io/qit-documentation/#/test-types/activation)
- [Security Test](https://woocommerce.github.io/qit-documentation/#/test-types/security)

## Documentation

For more detailed information on QIT and how to use it, refer to the [official documentation](https://woocommerce.github.io/qit-documentation/#/).

### Highlights

#### For End-to-End, Activation, and API Tests

- Choose the PHP version, ranging from 7.4 to 8.2.
- Select the WooCommerce and WordPress versions, including beta releases.
- Opt in to activate other extensions to check for potential conflicts.

#### For all Tests

- Integrate QIT as part of your pull requests with our example [GitHub Workflows integration](https://woocommerce.github.io/qit-documentation/#/workflows/getting-started).
- Create and share application passwords with your development team, allowing them to use the QIT CLI without having full access to your WooCommerce.com account.
