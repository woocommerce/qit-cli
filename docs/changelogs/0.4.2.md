### QIT CLI 0.4.2 Release Notes

- When encountering "429 - Too Many Requests" when starting tests, respect the "Retry-After" header if it's present, otherwise do an exponential backoff.
- When running on Windows without a Certificate Authority file, ask the user if they want to download a CA file to be used in QIT, related to https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/13601.
