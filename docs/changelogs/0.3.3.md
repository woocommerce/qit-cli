### QIT CLI 0.3.3 Release

This is an optional update.

- Improved onboarding experience for Automatticians.
- Protect user from accidentally leaking credentials if running "very verbose mode" in CI (With `-vvv` parameter). GitHub already obfuscates any secret in output, but this is an additional measure.
